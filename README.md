# Reactionary Flash Card App

This project is a Turing front-end evelopment project focused on working with React and Enzyme/Jest.

This is an app for people who are learning React and want to brush up on their terminology.  It comes with 35 out of box flash cards, and also allows users to create their own flash cards for anything they'd like to add.  There are three different game modes with varying levels of difficulty.

## How to Play

1. Go to Play and choose from three different game modes.
2. Guess mode shows you a term description and example, and you enter your guess.
3. Choice mode shows you a term description and example, and gives you three options to choose between.
4. Review mode shows you all the cards in the app, so you can brush up on your terminology for the Guess and Choice mode games.
5. Check out My Cards to create your own custom flash cards.  These will be added to the Guess mode games.
6. When all flash cards are answered, the game will restart from the beginning so you can play again any time.
7. See the Stats page to find out how many games you've completed and what your high score is.
8. Check out the Links page for useful resources for a learner of React.
